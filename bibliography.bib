abstract = {Nonparametric data from multi-factor experiments arise often in human-computer interaction (HCI). Examples may include error counts, Likert responses, and preference tallies. But because multiple factors are involved, common nonparametric tests (e.g., Friedman) are inadequate, as they are unable to examine interaction effects. While some statistical techniques exist to handle such data, these techniques are not widely available and are complex. To address these concerns, we present the Aligned Rank Transform (ART) for nonparametric factorial data analysis in HCI. The ART relies on a preprocessing step that "aligns" data before applying averaged ranks, after which point common ANOVA procedures can be used, making the ART accessible to anyone familiar with the F-test. Unlike most articles on the ART, which only address two factors, we generalize the ART to N factors. We also provide ARTool and ARTweb, desktop and Web-based programs for aligning and ranking data. Our re-examination of some published HCI results exhibits advantages of the ART.},

abstract = {Data from multifactor HCI experiments often violates the assumptions of parametric tests (i.e., nonconforming data). The Aligned Rank Transform (ART) has become a popular nonparametric analysis in HCI that can find main and interaction effects in nonconforming data, but leads to incorrect results when used to conduct post hoc contrast tests. We created a new algorithm called ART-C for conducting contrast tests within the ART paradigm and validated it on 72,000 synthetic data sets. Our results indicate that ART-C does not inflate Type I error rates, unlike contrasts based on ART, and that ART-C has more statistical power than a t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and ART. We also extended an open-source tool called ARTool with our ART-C algorithm for both Windows and R. Our validation had some limitations (e.g., only six distribution types, no mixed factorial designs, no random slopes), and data drawn from Cauchy distributions should not be analyzed with ART-C.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F(1) and F(2) tests, and in many cases, even worse than F(1) alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

	abstract = {Quantitative traits analyzed in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are often non-normally distributed. For such traits, association tests based on standard linear regression are subject to reduced power and inflated type I error in finite samples. Applying the rank-based Inverse Normal Transformation (INT) to non-normally distributed traits has become common practice in GWAS. However, the different variations on INT-based association testing have not been formally defined, and guidance is lacking on when to use which approach. In this paper, we formally define and systematically compare the direct (D-INT) and indirect (I-INT) INT-based association tests. We discuss their assumptions, underlying generative models, and connections. We demonstrate that the relative powers of D-INT and I-INT depend on the underlying data generating process. Since neither approach is uniformly most powerful, we combine them into an adaptive omnibus test (O-INT). O-INT is robust to model misspecification, protects the type I error, and is well powered against a wide range of non-normally distributed traits. Extensive simulations were conducted to examine the finite sample operating characteristics of these tests. Our results demonstrate that, for non-normally distributed traits, INT-based tests outperform the standard untransformed association test (UAT), both in terms of power and type I error rate control. We apply the proposed methods to GWAS of spirometry traits in the UK Biobank. O-INT has been implemented in the R package RNOmni, which is available on CRAN.},

abstract = {Exploring virtual worlds together with others adds a social component to the Virtual Reality (VR) experience that increases connectedness. In the physical world, joint locomotion comes naturally through implicit intention communication and subsequent adjustments of the movement patterns. In VR, however, discrete locomotion techniques such as point\&teleport come without prior intention communication, hampering the collective experience. Related work proposes fixed groups, with a single person controlling the group movement, resulting in the loss of individual movement capabilities. To close the gap and mediate between these two extremes, we introduce three intention communication methods and explore them with two baseline methods. We contribute the results of a controlled experiment (n=20) investigating these methods from the perspective of a leader and a follower in a dyadic locomotion task. Our results suggest shared visualizations support the understanding of movement intentions, increasing the group feeling while maintaining individual freedom of movement.},

Although the theoretical properties of these methods are well-known, no empirical results are available on these procedures. Two versions of the F-statistic analogue of the aligned rank method for interaction in two-way layouts are studied along with the classical F-test and the rank transform test that has been the focus of several studies in recent years. Based on extensive simulation studies we conclude that the aligned rank tests should generally be preferred in application. We further show that none of these tests performs well for the Cauchy distribution. We show that the problem with inflation in the Type I error rate of the rank transform statistic (Blair et al., 1987), can be overcome by the use of the normal scores.}

Using the geometric mean to estimate the center of the population will, on average, have 13\% less error and 22\% less bias than the sample median. Other estimates of the population center (trimmed, harmonic and Winsorized means) had worse performance than the sample median.},

The efficiency of labeling techniques is crucial to produce numerous qualitative labels, but existing techniques remain sparsely evaluated. We systematically evaluate the efficiency of tagging and browsing tasks in relation to the number of images displayed, interaction modes, and the image visual complexity. Tagging consists in focusing on a single image to assign multiple labels (image-oriented strategy), and browsing in focusing on a single label to assign to multiple images (label-oriented strategy). In a first experiment, we focus on the nudges inducing participants to adopt one of the strategies (n=18). In a second experiment, we evaluate the efficiency of the strategies (n=24). Results suggest an image-oriented strategy (tagging task) leads to shorter annotation times, especially for complex images, and participants tend to adopt it regardless of the conditions they face.},

	abstract = {Inconsistencies in the research findings on F-test robustness to variance heterogeneity could be related to the lack of a standard criterion to assess robustness or to the different measures used to quantify heterogeneity. In the present paper we use Monte Carlo simulation to systematically examine the Type I error rate of F-test under heterogeneity. One-way, balanced, and unbalanced designs with monotonic patterns of variance were considered. Variance ratio (VR) was used as a measure of heterogeneity (1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 2, 3, 5, and 9), the coefficient of sample size variation as a measure of inequality between group sizes (0.16, 0.33, and 0.50), and the correlation between variance and group size as an indicator of the pairing between them (1, .50, 0, −.50, and −1). Overall, the results suggest that in terms of Type I error a VR above 1.5 may be established as a rule of thumb for considering a potential threat to F-test robustness under heterogeneity with unequal sample sizes.},

This is unfortunate, as communicating meaningful task-related proficiency feedback could improve users’ awareness of their abilities and their willingness to improve. To highlight the feasibility of this concept, we evaluated how different methods of readability feedback impacted users during a text production task. In general, our results showed that having access to readability feedback allowed participants to reflect on their task solving approach, facilitating the users’ understanding of their proficiency. Revision-based methods are less distracting for the user than continuous feedback methods, while still offering high efficacy. Further, feedback should be paired with a subtle form of gamification elements. We envision this reflection-oriented design to user proficiency to be applicable to a variety of interactive systems, allowing for an improved and engaging user experience.},

@article{Brunner_ATS:2021,
	abstract = {In this paper, we summarize some recent developments in the analysis of nonparametric models where the classical models of ANOVA are generalized in such a way that not only the assumption of normality is relaxed but also the structure of the designs is introduced in a broader framework and also the concept of treatment effects is redefined. The continuity of the distribution functions is not assumed so that not only data from continuous distributions but also data with ties are included in this general setup. In designs with independent observations as well as in repeated measures designs, the hypotheses are formulated by means of the distribution functions. The main results are given in a unified form. Some applications to special designs are considered, where in simple designs, some well known statistics (such as the Kruskal-Wallis statistic and the χ2-statistic for dichotomous data) come out as special cases. The general framework presented here enables the nonparametric analysis of data with continuous distribution functions as well as arbitrary discrete data such as count data, ordered categorical and dichotomous data.},
