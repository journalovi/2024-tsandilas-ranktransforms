## The experimental-track JoVI article template

This repository contains the template for the [experimental track](https://www.journalovi.org/submit.html#experimental)
at JoVI.

Papers for this track are written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) which is an open source publishing format that supports inline code, including languages like R, Python, Julia, and JavaScript (via Observable Notebook).

To edit this template, edit [index.qmd](index.qmd). HTML output of the template is in [index.html](index.html) and can also be previewed online [here](https://www.journalovi.org/jovi-template-quarto/).
Please commit the HTML version of your paper to your repostiory when you submit so that reviewers can easily preview the paper.

We provide a few versions of the template:

- **Quarto**: [index.qmd](index.qmd). The main format used for publication, which 
is a simple markdown-based text format. We **strongly recommend** writing in this
format, as it will offer the most flexibility and control, but may be a less familiar
writing experience. For the experimental track, the other formats below will be
converted to this format for the final publication.

- **Jupyter notebook**: [index.ipynb](index.ipynb). You can write JoVI papers in 
jupyter notebook, which may be desirable if you wish to write JoVI papers using
a collaborative notebook authoring platform such as Juypter Lab or Google Colab.

- **Word**: [index.docx](index.docx). You can write JoVI papers in Word, however
you must be careful to use the built-in styles. During the final paper production
we will assist with conversion from Word to Quarto, but the process will likely
not be as smooth as the other formats.
