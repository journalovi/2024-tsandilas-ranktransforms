## Raw results

This folder presents the raw files generated from our experimental scripts and used for the analysis of the jovi article and the Appendix. The suffix *_10*, *_20*, and *_30* in the filenames corresponds to the sample size (size of experimental cell) used, as we ran the experiments separately for each sample size. 

The log files generally contain the following columns: 
- The sample size *n*.
- The experimental *design*, such as *4x3* and *2x3*.
- The data distribution (*distr*), such as *norm*, *lnorm*, and *binom*.
- The compared *method*, such as *PAR*, *RNK*, *INT*, and *ART*. 
- The *alpha* level, which is either *0.05* or *0.01*.
- The magnitude of main effects (e.g., *effectX1* and *effectX2*) and interaction effects (e.g., *effectX1X2*)
- The observed rate of positives for main effects (e.g., *rate1* and *rateX2*) and interacton effects (e.g., *rateX1X2*). Depending on the applied effects, this rate can represent the Type I error rate or the Power of the method.

Some files contain additional columns, such as the the max ratio of standard deviations among levels (*sd_ratio*) for experiments comparing the methods under unequal variances.
