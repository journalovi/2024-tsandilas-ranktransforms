## Simple tests to evaluate ART on binary data

The template files provide a structure for the sampled datasets. We provide templates for a 4x3 within-subjects design and two sample sizes: ``n=20`` and ``n=1000``.

The test files read the corresponding templates and replace the response variable with random binary values. They then evaluate the Type I error rate of ART and PAR. 

The ``/log`` directory shows our outputs when 0s and 1s appear with the same 50\% probability. For *n=20*, we used 3000 iterations but only 100 iterations for *n=1000*, because ART's Type I error rates are clearly huge in this case.
